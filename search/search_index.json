SQLite is a lightweight relational database engine that is often used for small and/or embedded databases because it doesn't require a separate server process and is easy to integrate into applications. The entire database including all of the tables, indices, and the data itself is stored in the database file on your computer. SQLite is highly portable and many desktop applications and mobile apps use it to store their data.</p> Important SQLite Considerations <p>When working with SQLite, be aware of the following important differences from larger relational database systems:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Type Affinity (Not Strict Typing) SQLite uses type affinity, which means columns have a recommended type but do not strictly enforce it. For example, inserting a string into a column declared as <code>INT</code> will not cause an error. This can lead to inconsistent data if not carefully managed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Foreign Keys Are Not Enforced by Default Unlike other databases, SQLite does NOT enforce foreign key constraints unless explicitly enabled. To ensure referential integrity, you must run: <pre><code>PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;\n</code></pre></p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"demos/02_implement_erd/#sql-autograder-warmup","title":"SQL Autograder Warmup","text":"<p>This demo will also be used as warmup exercise to get comfortable with the autograder format requirements that will be utilized for all SQL programming assignments for this course. <code>CP0_Autograder_Warmup</code> is worth 5 bonus points that will count towards the 100 participation points for the class.

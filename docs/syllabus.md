## COURSE OVERVIEW

### Course Description
Databases are the backbone of the digital world, storing most global data and enabling the seamless operation of most businesses. In this course, you will learn to design and visually represent database structures and develop practical skills in implementing these designs using relational database concepts. Central to this course is the mastery of Structured Query Language (SQL), the standard language for interacting with relational databases. You will gain hands-on experience in writing and optimizing SQL queries, from basic to advanced levels, using a variety of open-source database platforms. Additionally, the course will introduce you to essential topics in database architecture and NoSQL databases. By the end of the course, you will be proficient in creating, modifying, retrieving, and analyzing data, preparing you with the essential skills needed to drive data-informed decisions in any professional setting.

### Homework
There are 5 homework assignments consisting of problem-solving and SQL based programming assignments. While you are allowed to use AI tools to support your learning during homework, it is essential to ensure you fully understand the reasoning and process behind the solutions. AI will **not** be permitted during exams, so developing your ability to work through problems independently is critical for success. 

### Quizzes
There are 5 quizzes that focus primarily on the conceptual materials covered in the lectures and textbook. The format will vary between True/False, multiple choice, matching and fill in the blank style questions. Quizzes should be straightforward if you are attending class and keeping up with the material. At least 5 out of the 15 questions for each quiz are selected from the lecture Slido quizzes. Quizzes are just a way to make sure you keep up with studying and do not fall too far behind as this class really builds on each previous week. Quizzes are completed on Canvas and by yourself with no collaboration/communication with any other students or AI tools.

!!! tip
    Use homework and quiz assignments as an opportunity to practice and solidify your understanding, so you’re well-prepared for exam-style questions.

### Class Participation
There are 5 class participation assignments that are designed to help you learn by doing, first by following along with instructor demos, then by immediately applying the same concepts on your own using materials from the current lecture/demo materials. Each participation assignment is designed to be finished during class, but late submission is permitted by the end of the lecture day.

!!! note "Class Attendance"
    The goal is to make lectures worth your while to attend. Some class dates may only consist of a lecture but the vast majority of classes will involve hands-on practice with database and SQL tools. Regular attendance is very important to your success in this course. 

### Group Project
There are 3 group project assignments that you will be able to collaborate with 3-5 classmates on a real-world dataset to apply all skills learned in the course, including ER modeling, database design, normalization and data loading, and SQL query construction.

### Final Exam
The final exam is open-note and completed online by yourself with no collaboration/communication with any other students and AI tools. No late exams are permitted, except for extenuating circumstances. Please reach out as early as possible if you know something will prevent you from completing the exam on the designated date.  

### Late Submission Policy
There is a 24-hour grace period for all **homework** assignments with **NO** late penalty. Assignment submissions will **NOT** be accepted after the grace period. This policy is intended to be a safety net in case you experience any difficulties submitting your assignment on time. Do not view the grace period as the true due date for the assignment. If you miss an assignment due date, it is likely that you are not managing your time effectively and will need to adjust your planning and study habits. Please note that any excuse for not submitting assignments on time will not be accepted **AFTER** the 24-hour grace period. If you have extenuating circumstances, you must contact the professor **BEFORE** the assignment due date.

### Regrade Policy
The intent of the regrade policy is to protect students from serious issues in grading. Email the professor within **72 hours** and provide evidence for why your answer is correct and merits a regrade (i.e. a specific reference to something said in a lecture, the readings, or office hours). Make sure you confer with your team first on any group completed project and submit one regrade request after your team comes to a consensus.
